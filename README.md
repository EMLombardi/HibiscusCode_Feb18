==================

Where I'm at now. 

This code is for spatial point processes. 
I am writing it using only one plot, but will eventually scale it up and run it again and again and again with different variables.

Essentially, the points and polygons are shapefiles.
I have mapped the observed points and randomly generated points over the area in question. 

Coding is being done in R. Spatial stats will be conducted to determine clustering....but I'm not yet sure how to do this 
with the polygons.
